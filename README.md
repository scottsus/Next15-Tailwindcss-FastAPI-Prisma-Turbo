# PyTS Prisma Turborepo üèéÔ∏è

Lightweight Next 15 frontend, FastAPI server, shared Prisma ORM, and excellent dev tooling. Everything you need to start your next failed side project.

## Quick Start

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Why Python?

Oftentimes a Next.js frontend will call Python libraries, which may influence state and make changes to the DB. Examples include audio/video processing and machine learning. It's ideal to therefore work with a single ORM and a single schema file - a single source of truth.
